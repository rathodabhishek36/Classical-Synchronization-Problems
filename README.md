# Classical-Synchronization-Problems
CSN-232 Operating Systems
The folders contain the solutions to the process synchronization problems which are Producer-Consumer problem, Readers-Writers problem, Cigarette-Smokers problem, Sleeping-Barbers problem and the Dining-Philosophers problem. The code is implemented using my custom built Semaphore library named "my_semaphore.h". Along with that, I have also used Pthreads inbuilt library for to create the crcumstances to apply process synchronization.
To run the code on the terminal,
First compile the code file using the command :- gcc Dining_philosopher.c -pthread 
                                    for a file named Dining_philosopher.c
Then use the command :- ./a.out  to execute the program.
